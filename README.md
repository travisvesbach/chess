# chess 

Start date: August 28, 2017
Finish date: September 2, 2017

Notes:
Overall, building chess went well.  It was a challenging project that really put together many things that I learned about Ruby in the past couple months.  The hardest part was getting the check/checkmate system to work properly, but I eventually figured out a working solution.
